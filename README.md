# ðŸ¤– Resume Screener using NLP & Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project builds an intelligent **Resume Screening System** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multiple machine learning models. It analyzes and classifies resumes based on their content, enabling automated candidate filtering for HR teams or recruitment tools.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Text processing with **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- âœ… Multi-label classification using:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
- âœ… Evaluation with Accuracy, Confusion Matrix & Classification Report

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models

Three models were trained and evaluated:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors**
2. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
3. **Random Forest Classifier**

Each model is wrapped with `OneVsRestClassifier` for multi-label classification.

---

## ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation

Each model was evaluated using:
- âœ… **Accuracy**
- âœ… **Confusion Matrix**
- âœ… **Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)**

You can compare these metrics to decide the best performing model for deployment.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements
- Add deep learning models (e.g., BERT, LSTM) for better text understanding
- Deploy on AWS as an API for real-time screening
